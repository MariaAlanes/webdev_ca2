Data Manipulation and Validation

Produce a set of HTML files with the shared CSS styling that can read the database file and execute each query and answer questions from the Databases CA (Clause 1):
1. Use a SQL.js library and build HTML files, which will render the results of SQL queries run against an SQLite database in a browser:
● part1.1.html for Part 1.1 ● part1.3.html for Part 1.3
● part1.2.html for Part 1.2
[1 mark]
2. You must assume that the original employees.db file is placed in the same folder where the HTML file is, but you must not include it, since the file exceeds the file size allowed by GitHub, when unarchived
[1 mark]
3. Please create .gitignore file (like we did in class) in your repository and include employees.db there, so
this file will be ignored and not be uploaded to GitHub [1 mark]
4. CSS file (style.css) should be in the same folder – you are free to use Bootstrap, if desired [1 mark]
5. Each question should have its question number and any sub-part numbers included in the button; Make sure you link all HTML files together in the upper right menu and the current page is shown in
bold [1 mark]
6. Each query should have a green Execute button that executes each query and renders the results in the destination <div> [1 mark]
7. Each successful SQL query output will count as 0.5 marks in the WebDev CA (use must use LIMIT 100 or 1000 in your SQL code as some of the queries with 1M records in the database can’t be processed by a browser) [10 marks]
8. Make sure you use HTML Escape Characters when putting SQL commands inside data-sql attribute
[1 mark]
9. Your HTML page should be well-formed and pass validation – https://validator.w3.org [1 mark]
10. The CSS file should be external, be shared among all HTML pages and should pass validation –
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ [1 mark]
11. All the files should be presented in a public GitHub repository with at least 6 commits history and the full link to this repository (of the following format: https://github.com/<your username>/webdev_ca2) must be included on the cover page of the submitted PDF – this aspect is also critical and is being marked (all final files must also be included in the zip with your submission) [1 mark]

You might get 0 for WebDev if the proper GitHub link is not present, it is not of the following format or it cannot be easily identified: https:/github.com/<username>/webdev_ca2
